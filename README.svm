This is the developmental, and so far unreleased, version of a port of
the SvmPcg code to the new version of OOQP.  The major changes are 1)
a transpose of the sense of the matrix in SvmData, 2) the conversion
of the same matrix to a sparse format, 3) the introduction of the
ability to use a preconditioned conjugate gradient method with a
Svm-specific preconditioner to solve the linear systems; and 4) the
introduction of a routine to read data in SVMlight format.

The SvmPcg code was written by E. Michael Gertz and Joshua Griffin.
